## 🏗️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Git
- (Optional) Docker for container testing

### Setup Steps

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/isaacpalomero/mcp_tools.git
cd mcp_tools

# 2. Run automated setup
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# 3. Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 4. Install development dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov flake8 mypy black

# 5. Run tests to verify setup
pytest
```

## 📝 Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with these specifics:

- **Line length:** Maximum 100 characters
- **Indentation:** 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Quotes:** Single quotes for strings (unless double needed)
- **Imports:** Organize imports (stdlib, third-party, local)

### Code Formatting

We use **Black** for automatic formatting:

```bash
# Format code
black .

# Check formatting
black --check .
```

### Type Hints

All public functions and methods must have type hints:

```python
# ✅ Good
def search_prompts(query: str, n_results: int = 5) -> List[Dict]:
    pass

# ❌ Bad
def search_prompts(query, n_results=5):
    pass
```

### Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions:

```python
def calculate_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:
    """
    Calculate semantic similarity between two texts.
    
    Args:
        text1: First text to compare
        text2: Second text to compare
        
    Returns:
        Similarity score between 0.0 and 1.0
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If either text is empty
        
    Examples:
        >>> calculate_similarity("hello world", "hello there")
        0.85
    """
    pass
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_mcp_server.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run only unit tests
pytest tests/unit/

# Run only integration tests
pytest tests/integration/
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Name test files `test_*.py`
- Name test functions `test_*`
- Use descriptive test names: `test_search_prompts_returns_relevant_results`

**Example test:**

```python
def test_create_prompt_with_valid_content():
    """Test that create_prompt successfully creates a prompt"""
    content = "Test prompt content"
    result = create_prompt(content=content, category="testing")
    
    assert "✅ Prompt created successfully!" in result[0].text
    assert "testing" in result[0].text
```

## 📋 Commit Messages
